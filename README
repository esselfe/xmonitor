xmonitor is a system monitor written in the C programming language.
As of now it can render a memory and a swap meter directly in a
positionable window without borders or decoration, using the
X11/Xorg/Xlib interface.

Compiling the source into an executable program is simple, just type 'make'
in the source directory and copy xmonitor where you see fit.

Enjoy!
