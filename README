xmonitor is a system monitor written in the C programming language.
As of now it only renders a memory meter directly on the desktop,
aka 'root window', using the X11/Xorg/Xlib interface

Compiling the source into an executable form is simple, just type 'make'
in the source directory and copy xmonitor where you see fit.

Enjoy!
